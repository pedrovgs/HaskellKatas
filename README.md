# HaskellKatas [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/HaskellKatas.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/HaskellKatas)

Haskell training repository used to learn Haskell and functional programming.


### List of katas:

* [FizzBuzz](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz).
* [String calculator](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/).
* [Finding the right triangle](https://gist.github.com/pedrovgs/32189838165fbe5c9e773ede534b97f4).
* [Rock paper scissors](http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/RockPaperScissors-Kata).


### Executing tests:

All these katas are covered using unit and [property based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) tests. If you want to build and execute the project tests you just need to install [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) and [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and execute the following command:

```
stack build --test
```

If you want to review if there is any pending execution branch to be covered you can generate a coverage report executing the following command:

```
stack build --test --coverage
```

As some of the tests have been developed using [QuickCheck](https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_QuickCheck2) if you want to review the input used for our tests you can replace any ``property`` invocation in any spec for ``verboseCheck``. Doing this all the values used as input will be shown on the terminal before to execute any property based test.

If you are going to modify the code or just review the implementation from any IDE I strongly recommend you to install [Atom](https://atom.io/) following this [guide](https://github.com/simonmichael/haskell-atom-setup) to set up the whole Haskell environment in a few minutes.
